Repo to keep track of my progress learning JavaScript in depth.

# Why I'm focusing on javascript?
Javascript is eating the world of software. Javascript rules the web. More and more web apps, IoT devices, mobile apps, cloud services, and wearable computing rely on JavaScript. I want to be part of the software world and it's obvious that without really knowng JavaScript it will be difficult to be part of the software revolution.
 
I covered javascript in a web programming college course that I took 3 years ago, however, we all know that college courses don't go in debt as one would wished. It was a good introduction to javascript, but I really want to learn the language in more debt. Therefore, I'll be keeping track of my progress in this repo as I reallylearn javascript in the debt.
